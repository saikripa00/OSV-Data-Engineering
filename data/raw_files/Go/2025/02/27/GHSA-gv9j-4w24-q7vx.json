  "summary": "Improper random number generation in github.com/coredns/coredns",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nCoreDNS before 1.6.6 (using go DNS package < 1.1.25) improperly generates random numbers because math/rand is used. The TXID becomes predictable, leading to response forgeries.\n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been fixed in 1.6.6+.\n\n### References\n- [CVE-2019-19794](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19794)\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/blob/master/.github/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding our security process.\n",
