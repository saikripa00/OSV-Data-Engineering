  "summary": "Rancher's SAML-based login via CLI can be denied by unauthenticated users",
  "details": "### Impact\nA vulnerability has been identified within Rancher where it is possible for an unauthenticated user to list all CLI authentication tokens and delete them before the CLI is able to get the token value. This effectively prevents users from logging in via the CLI when using rancher token as the execution command (instead of the token directly being in the kubeconfig). \n\nNote that this token is not the kubeconfig token and if an attacker is able to intercept it they can't use it to impersonate a real user since it is encrypted.\n\nThis happens because for SAML-based authentication providers, the login flow from the CLI works by generating a link to be pasted in the browser, and then polling every 10 seconds for the `/v3-public/authTokens/<token name>` endpoint.  The `<token name>` is randomly generated by the CLI. Once the login flow succeeds, Rancher creates an auth token (with an encrypted token value). The CLI then deletes the authToken.\n\n\nRancher deployments using only the local authentication provider, or non-SAML-based authentication providers, are not impacted by this vulnerability. SAML-based users not using the CLI are also not impacted.\n\n\nPlease consult the associated  [MITRE ATT&CK - Technique - Account Access Removal](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1531/) for further information about this category of attack.\n\n### Patches\nThe fix involves removing GET and DELETE methods for the authTokens collection.\n\nPatched versions include releases `v2.8.13`, `v2.9.7` and `v2.10.3`.\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers can refrain from using the Rancher CLI to log in as a workaround. Otherwise, users are advised to upgrade to a patched version of Rancher Manager.\n\n### References\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n- Reach out to the [SUSE Rancher Security team](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/policy) for security related inquiries.\n- Open an issue in the [Rancher](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/new/choose) repository.\n- Verify with our [support matrix](https://www.suse.com/suse-rancher/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/) and [product support lifecycle](https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/).",
