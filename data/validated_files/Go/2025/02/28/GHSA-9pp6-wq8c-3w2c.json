  "summary": "Gogs allows argument injection during the previewing of changes",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nUnprivileged user accounts can write to arbitrary files on the filesystem. We could demonstrate its exploitation to force a re-installation of the instance, granting administrator rights. It allows accessing and altering any user's code hosted on the same instance.\n\n### Patches\n\nUnintended Git options has been ignored for diff preview (https://github.com/gogs/gogs/pull/7871). Users should upgrade to 0.13.1 or the latest 0.14.0+dev.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNo viable workaround available, please only grant access to trusted users to your Gogs instance on affected versions.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39932\n",
