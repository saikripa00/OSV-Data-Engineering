  "details": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. `DenseBincount` assumes its input tensor `weights` to either have the same shape as its input tensor `input` or to be length-0. A different `weights` shape will trigger a `CHECK` fail that can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit bf4c14353c2328636a18bfad1e151052c81d5f43. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
